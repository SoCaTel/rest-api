# REST API Endpoints

This project contains an array of endpoints that expose useful insights and analytics of the SoCaTel user base.

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing 
purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

All tools and processes are meant to be deployed under a docker container. To get everything set up, you should:

* Have docker installed in your machine. See [this](https://runnable.com/docker/install-docker-on-linux) for a general 
guide on Linux machines (preferred OS for this project).

The docker container used will take care of installing node and all packages required to expose endpoints included here.

You will need to have the following setup, found in the [SoCaTel](https://github.com/SoCaTel/) group:
* DSE Flask application, housed in the `backend-storage` github repo, responsible for synchronising data insertion from
 the front-end to GraphDB and Elasticsearch
* GraphQL, for semantic repository queries, exposed through API calls.
* Elasticsearch, for direct queries to the database. For help in setting this up and the necessary Elasticsearch indices
, refer to [this](https://github.com/SoCaTel/elasticsearch-schema) repository.
* MongoDB, for accessing recommendation and semantic engine's stored outputs from periodical runs

## Configurations

Under the [configuration](config.js) file, change the `Elasticsearch`, `GraphQL` and `MongoDB` related fields, based on your current setup.

Basic authorisation is also supported, so you should change the following based on a unique set of username and password:

* `restapi_username`
* `restapi_password`

The default port used is 8192, if you need to change it, edit the `restapi_port` parameter.

## Deployment

Retrieve the `<mongodb_network_name>` in the [docker container preparation script](./docker_build.sh) from the second 
line of the following command's output (the MongoDB setup is done in the sentiment classification engine component 
setup):
`docker inspect <mongo_image_id> | grep -A 2 "Networks"`

Then run `./docker_build.sh` to deploy this on your Linux machine of choice.
Access the GUI (built on Swagger) through: `<host>:8192/api-docs/#/`, where host is your Linux machine's IP address (the
 docker exposes the application on localhost).

## Built With

* [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) - The secure way to build and share this application, anywhere.
* [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) - A powerful Javascript runtime where scalable network applications are built.
* [Swagger](https://swagger.io/) - Used for API documentation and exposure on its GUI tool
